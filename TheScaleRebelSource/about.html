        <h1>I don't do templates.</h1>
        <p class="lede">I design and build websites as finished products — not ongoing services. You get a site that works, that you own, and that doesn't depend on me.</p>

            <h2>The Short Version</h2>
            <p>
              I started Scale Rebel because I got tired of watching businesses get stuck with bloated templates, page-builder lock-in, and websites they couldn't actually own. So I build the opposite: fast, clean, custom sites that you control completely.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first major client project — <a href="https://madisontattoocompany.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MadisonTattooCompany.com</a> — shipped as a complete product: design, development, security hardening, deployment, and full ownership transfer. That's the standard.

            <h2>What I Actually Care About</h2>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Figuring out what your business actually needs online — not what a template gives you</li>
              <li>Security that's part of the build, not a plugin you hope works</li>
              <li>Sites that load fast because there's nothing unnecessary in them</li>
              <li>Handing you the keys and walking away — no monthly retainer, no dependency on me</li>

          <p>Most web designers sell you a service. I sell you a product.</p>

          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>No CMS Tax</strong>
            <span>No WordPress updates to worry about, no plugins to patch, no database to secure. Your site is static, fast, and bulletproof.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>Real Security</strong>
            <span>Edge-function filtering, content security policies, bot blocking, and input sanitization. Not an afterthought — part of how every site is built.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>Portable Code</strong>
            <span>Everything is standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can take it to any host, hire any developer to modify it, or change nothing for years. It just works.</span>
